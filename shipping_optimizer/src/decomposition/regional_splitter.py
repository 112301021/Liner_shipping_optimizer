regional_splitter.py — Fixed v2
================================
KEY FIX: Each OD demand is assigned to EXACTLY ONE region: the region that
contains its ORIGIN port.  The previous `origin OR destination` logic caused
the same demand to appear in 2–3 regions simultaneously, silently inflating
satisfied_demand, revenue, and coverage metrics by 2–3×.

Cross-region demands (origin in region A, destination in region B):
  - Assigned to origin's region (Option A from spec).
  - MILP in that region will model them as unserved if no direct or
    transshipment path exists — which is correct: they count against coverage.

Services are included if ANY port on the service is in the region.  This
allows trunk/feeder services that straddle region boundaries to still be
considered, giving the MILP the routing flexibility it needs.
